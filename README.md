##  About this App:
This APP is the test demo version of thesis SmartShell, there are some bugs. Due to the different development test environment, the test effect may not meet the expectations. However, the developer believes that this APP has several advantages as follows:
* The developer extracted the WiFi module and Bluetooth module to achieve decoupling from the traditional APP wireless framework APP.
* The developer provides a design module to measure wireless RSSI
* The developer provides an architecture that can be iterated downward, namely the SmartShellAdapter framework

## BTWï¼š
I am still the sole developer of the MCU for this paper, except that I think the development process is very simple, but anyone with a little development base can implement this, so I won't provide it. I can open source it afterwards if there is a need.

And again, I declare that the development of these two software **has nothing to do with the first author of the paper**, because he did not contribute anything. The funny thing is that ninety percent of the workload of this system design also has nothing to do with him in fact, so let's just laugh about it.
