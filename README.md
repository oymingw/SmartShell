##  About this App:
This APP is the test demo version of thesis SmartShell, there are some bugs. Due to the different development test environment, the test effect may not meet the expectations. However, the developer believes that this APP has several advantages as follows:
* The developer extracted the WiFi module and Bluetooth module to achieve decoupling from the traditional APP wireless framework APP.
* The developer provides a design module to measure wireless RSSI
* The developer provides an architecture that can be iterated downward, namely the SmartShellAdapter framework
